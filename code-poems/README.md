# code poems

Requires a C/C++ compiler.

## the_silence_as_i_wait_for_you_to_respond.sh
### Run
```
$ chmod +x the_silence_as_i_wait_for_you_to_respond.sh
$ ./the_silence_as_i_wait_for_you_to_respond.sh
```

## time.cpp

all of the time
you spent worrying about the future,
what would you do with it
if you had it back


## unsaid.cpp
I learned some template metaprogramming to express that there were things I wasn't
brave enough to tell you.

### Run
Build as follows. The last part of the poem is in the note of the compiler error. Uncomment line 19 to fix.
```
$ clang++ unsaid.cpp
```
## re_curse.cpp

Where does it end? What happens when the world segfaults?


### Build
```
$ clang++ re_curse.cpp
```
### Run
```
$ ./a.out
```
